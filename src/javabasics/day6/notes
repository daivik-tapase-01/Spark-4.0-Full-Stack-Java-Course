String

A String in java is an Class that represent a sequence of characters

How to create a String Object->
1. using literal  ... it gets created in SCP / we use this for Memory Management
2. using new keyword  ... it gets created in Heap and a copy is created in SCP

String name = "Daivik"  --> String Constant Pool (SCP)
String name = new String();  --> Heap

== -> in case of primitive it compares values
== -> in case of non primitive it compares reference
.equals()

1. StringBuffer-> mutable, Thread safe, slower
2. StringBuilder-> mutable, not Thread safe, faster
