Java 8

1. Functional interface  
2. Lamda expression
3. Predicate 
4. Functions
5. Stream

Functional interface : it is an interface which only has one abstract method nothing else
1. Runnable

* what?
an interface with exactly one abstract method
* why?
to make java functional, to reduce boilerplate code
* syntax?
interface Calcy{
    int add();
}

functional interface and lambda expression works together

@FunctionalInterface
public interface Calcy {
    int add(int a, int b);  // SAM - single abstract method
}
@FunctionalInterface- this doesn't allow multiple abstract method in interface


** Lambda expression
1. shorthand to implement a functional interface

why?
1. no boilerplate code
2. code looks clean

syntax:
(parameter) -> {logic}

if you have one line in logic then no need of curly braces
