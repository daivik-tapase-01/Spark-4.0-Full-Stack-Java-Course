Synchronization:
In multithreading, synchronization is important to make sure multiple threads safely work on shared resources.

synchronization method or block which is good practice?
block synchronization is good practice
block lock a thread and releases it for another thread to use

Inter Thread communication
1. wait()
2. notify()
3. notifyAll()

-- wait() - this method is called on an object within a synchronized context/area to make the current wait until another thread invokes notify() or notifyAll()
when thread calls wait() it release the lock on the object and enter into the waiting state

-- Notify() - this is called on an object within synchronized context to wake up a waiting thread.
when notify() is invoked it notifies on of the thread that are in waiting on the object to wake up.
the choice of which thread to notify is not specific and depends on the JVM.

-- notifyAll() - this method is similar to notify(), but it wakes up all thread that are waiting on the same object

Qu. which all methods are release and acquire lock in multithreading?
