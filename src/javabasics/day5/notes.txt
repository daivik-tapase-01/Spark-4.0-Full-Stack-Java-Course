there are three principles in OPPs

1. Ecapsulation: process of binding data and method in single unit is called encapsulation

2. Inheritance: 
OverRiding-> using same method but writing on it 

Super keyword: refers to parent object , call parent constructor

single: one child one parent
multilevel: child-> parent -> grandparent
hierarchical: one parent, multiple childs
multiple: not supported 

Base clsss: Child
Parent class: Father
Super class: Grandfather

3. Polymorphism: many forms
types:  
compile time -> method OverLoding / method resolution should take care vy jvm at compile time 
run time -> method OverRiding / method 



4. Abstraction: Hinding internal details and showing necessary info 
hiding: private
showing: public
