Interface & Abstract Class

Abstract: abstract class in java is class that cannot be instantiated.
Abstract method: method without body
Concrete method: with body

when class is abstract class?
1. jab class me koi bhi ek abstract method hota hota hai

Abstract class is not able to achieve 100% abstraction
Interface is able to achieve 100% abstraction

1. all methods are implicitly public and abstract
2. we can`t create object of interface
3. all variable are public final static
4. until java 1.8 we don`t have any concrete method inside interfaces after java 1.8 we can put default and static method


* in real time abstract is not used much, most of the time interface will be used

1. when you have 50% information about the class action then go for abstract class
Animal{
    concrete...
    abstract method
}

2. use interface when we don`t have any information about the class, and we want the child to implement and give implementation

interface --- 100% abstract
abstract --- not 100% abstract

class -- extends -- class
class -- implements -- interface
interface -- extends -- interface
